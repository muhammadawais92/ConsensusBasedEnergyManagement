Project Description

This project proposes a distributed energy management optimization approach for an Active Distribution Network with high penetration of distributed generation, renewable energy sources, and energy storage. To overcome the limitations of traditional centralized control, a fully distributed consensus-based algorithm is applied, reducing computational burden and avoiding single-point failure.

A distributed consensus protocol is used to solve a social welfare maximization problem in a 33-bus distribution system equipped with distributed generators, photovoltaic units, wind sources, and battery storage. The incremental cost of electricity is selected as the consensus variable, while only local power mismatch and incremental cost information are exchanged between neighboring agents, ensuring scalability and privacy.

The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated using full-day renewable generation and load profiles. Performance is evaluated under peak load conditions, varying demand, and plug-and-play operation of distributed resources. A convergence speed analysis is also presented to study the impact of algorithm parameters on convergence behavior.
