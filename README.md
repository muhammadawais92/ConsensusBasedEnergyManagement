Project Overview

A fully distributed solution to the economic dispatch problem using a graph-theoretic consensus algorithm is proposed in this work.

The total load demand and generation balance are maintained using only local mismatch information at each bus. Unlike other related approaches, the proposed scheme does not require any virtual node to share the total demand among agents initially.

The algorithm is tested under various conditions, including plug-and-play scenarios and variable load demand in a microgrid structure. Simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm converges to the optimal solution across all cases, validating its effectiveness.

Furthermore, the idea is extended to a larger network to evaluate scalability, where the algorithm again achieves convergence while maintaining power balance.

In future work, transmission and communication channel losses, as well as channel noise, will be considered to further analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed scheme.
